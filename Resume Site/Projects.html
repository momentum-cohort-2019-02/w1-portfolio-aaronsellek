<li class="Store"><p>In this project I created a Webpage for a <a href="../w1d2-small-business-html-aaronsellek/Webpage/Homepage.html">Garden Supply Store</a> with the homepage linking to the stock and the contact page. In the stock page you can find the flowers with their pictures and a short section about the flowers that are being sold. In the contact page you can see the contact information for the store with a shoutout to Momentum(in that if you actually look up the address listed it gives you information about the Momentum school). </p></li>


    <h3><strong>Dog Adoption Website</strong></h3>

    <li class="Dog"> <p>In this project I created a webpage for a <a href="../w1d3-dog-adoption-site-aaronsellek/Dog Site/DogSite.html">Dog Adoption Website</a> and worked on creating radio, and check boxes. On top of this I got a chance to work on formating list items into bubbles and got a chance to practice and work with "flexing" items and pictures. I also got a chance to work with adding links into sentences and making sure that they were clickable on the site and led to the correct page.</p></li>
